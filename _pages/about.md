<!-- =======================================================
     Short Bio
     ======================================================= -->
I am a postdoctoral Research Associate in **Professor Kin K. Leung’s group** at Imperial College London, supported by the EPSRC project **Distributed Quantum Computing and Applications** (EP/W032643/1).  
My work lies at the intersection of **distributed quantum algorithms, scalable quantum architectures, and quantum error-correction strategies**. I am particularly interested in harnessing heterogeneous quantum networks to tackle large-scale optimisation, machine-learning, and quantum-materials-simulation problems.

Previously, I completed both my MSc and PhD in Quantum Engineering at Imperial, where I developed microwave-based quantum devices and high-fidelity read-out protocols. Before academia, I was an **R&D Device Engineer at TSMC**.
