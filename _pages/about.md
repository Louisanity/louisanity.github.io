## Biography

Louis Chen is a postdoctoral Research Associate at Imperial College London, working in the group of Professor Kin K. Leung. His position is supported by the EPSRC-funded project *Distributed Quantum Computing and Applications* ([EP/W032643/1](https://gtr.ukri.org/projects?ref=EP%2FW032643%2F1)).

His research addresses scalable approaches to distributed quantum computing, focusing on the design of quantum algorithms, distributed architectures, and novel quantum error correction protocols. Louis is particularly interested in how heterogeneous quantum networks can be leveraged to solve large-scale problems in optimisation, machine learning, and quantum materials simulation.

He received his MSc and PhD in Quantum Engineering from Imperial College London, where he specialised in device-level quantum information processing. His doctoral work included the development of microwave-based quantum readout systems and hybrid quantum-classical interface protocols. Prior to academia, he was an R&D Device Engineer at TSMC.
