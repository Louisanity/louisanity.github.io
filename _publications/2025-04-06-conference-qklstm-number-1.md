This paper introduces **QK-LSTM**, a **Quantum Kernel-Based Long Short-Term Memory** architecture that fuses quantum computing with classical recurrent models for efficient sequence learning. Notable features include:

* Embedding input data into a **quantum feature space**, enabling compact representation of complex temporal dependencies.  
* **Reduced parameter count** compared to classical LSTMs while maintaining equivalent modeling accuracy.  
* Enhanced **convergence and robustness**, making the architecture ideal for **edge devices** and **NISQ-limited quantum hardware**.

Benchmark results show that QK-LSTM delivers competitive performance with greater efficiency, offering a practical path forward for quantum-enhanced sequence modeling in applications like **natural language processing** and **real-time signal analysis**.
