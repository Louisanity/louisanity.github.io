This work presents a **noise-aware distributed QAOA** framework designed to overcome the limitations of **Noisy Intermediate-Scale Quantum (NISQ)** hardware. Key innovations include:

* **Problem decomposition** across multiple QPUs to bypass limited qubit counts.  
* **Error mitigation techniques** that enhance qubit fidelity and gate operation accuracy in noisy conditions.  
* Benchmarking using the **HamilToniQ toolkit**, validating improved speed and accuracy across different quantum hardware platforms.

The proposed strategy advances practical quantum optimization by combining hardware-aware design with distributed execution, paving the way toward scalable and efficient quantum computing in the NISQ era.
