**CompressedMediQ** presents a scalable hybrid quantum-classical pipeline tailored to the demands of **high-dimensional neuroimaging data**, particularly for **dementia staging**. The pipeline features:

* **Classical HPC-powered pre-processing** and **CNN-PCA-based feature extraction** to address data dimensionality constraints.  
* **Quantum Support Vector Machine (QSVM)** classification for optimized feature mapping and superior separability.  
* Application to real-world datasets (e.g., **ADNI** and **NIFD**), demonstrating higher accuracy than classical-only methods.

Despite limitations in qubit availability under NISQ constraints, CompressedMediQ validates the potential of quantum-enhanced diagnostics in healthcare, advancing the future of signal processing and neuroimaging analysis.
