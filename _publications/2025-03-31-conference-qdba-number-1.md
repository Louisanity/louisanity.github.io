This paper introduces a **noise-aware Byzantine agreement protocol** tailored for **distributed quantum computing (DQC)**, combining error mitigation and secure verification mechanisms. Key features include:

* Integration of **Quantum Readout Error Mitigation (QREM)** and **Dynamical Decoupling (DD)** to combat quantum channel noise on NISQ devices.  
* A **QKD-inspired verification mechanism** to ensure reliable command transmission among distributed nodes.  
* A **detectable consensus protocol** that enables lieutenants to systematically resolve discrepancies based on the commander’s input and network configuration.

Empirical results on IBM quantum hardware and simulations confirm enhanced **fault tolerance**, **security**, and **scalability**, paving the way for robust DQC coordination in adversarial settings.
