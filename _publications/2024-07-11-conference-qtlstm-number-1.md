This study applies the **Quantum-Train (QT)** framework to enhance Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) models for **flood prediction**, a task of growing urgency under climate change. Key features of this approach include:

* **Polylogarithmic parameter reduction** via quantum machine learning during training, enabling efficient model compression.  
* **Direct processing of classical data** without the need for quantum embedding.  
* A fully **classical inference stage**, removing the requirement for quantum hardware after training.

Originally validated in QHack 2024, the QT-enhanced LSTM delivers a practical and scalable solution for improving flood forecasting accuracy, ultimately supporting better preparedness and disaster response systems.
