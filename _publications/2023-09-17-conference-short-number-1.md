This paper evaluates two IBM quantum devices—**Eagle r3 (Sherbrooke, 127 qubits)** and **Falcon r8 (Peekskill, 27 qubits)**—focusing on their ability to generate high-fidelity Greenberger–Horne–Zeilinger (GHZ) states. By introducing **tree-based** and **centered-tree-based** shallow-depth circuit constructions, the study significantly improves entanglement fidelity while mitigating hardware errors.

Key contributions include:

* **Depth-reduction strategies** that exploit device topology to minimize two-qubit gate counts.  
* A comparative **benchmark** of Sherbrooke’s large-scale architecture versus Peekskill’s mid-scale layout.  
* Demonstration that higher qubit counts enable richer applications in quantum cryptography, measurement-based quantum computing, and quantum simulation.  

These results establish a practical pathway for preparing entangled states on today’s NISQ hardware, laying the groundwork for more efficient and versatile future quantum systems.
