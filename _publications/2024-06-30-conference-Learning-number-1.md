Quantum Phase Estimation (QPE) traditionally depends on an inverse Quantum Fourier Transform, making circuit depth grow rapidly with desired precision. This paper proposes a **variational quantum circuit (VQC) approximation** that:

* **Reduces QPE depth** while preserving estimation accuracy.  
* **Outperforms** noisy QPE simulations and standard QPE on real IBM hardware by mitigating gate errors.  
* Integrates as an intermediate **compiler pass**, promising depth savings for algorithms whose complexity is dominated by QPE.

The results show that adaptive, trainable circuits can improve near-term quantum algorithm performance and remain compatible with future, larger-scale devices.
