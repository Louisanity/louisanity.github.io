This paper proposes **Dist-QTRL**, a quantum-train-based framework for **Distributed Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning (RL)** that addresses scalability and training complexity. Key contributions include:

* **Parameterized quantum circuits** reduce trainable parameters from \( N \) to \( \text{polylog}(N) \), boosting efficiency.  
* **Parallel training** across multiple agents modeled as QPUs enhances convergence speed and scalability.  
* A hybrid **quantum–HPC workflow**, enabling quantum training with classical inference using CPUs/GPUs for real-world deployment.

Empirical results validate the **convergence** and **performance gains** over centralized RL models, highlighting the promise of quantum-enhanced RL in distributed, high-dimensional environments.
