This paper introduces **QT-CNN**, a hybrid **Quantum-Trained Convolutional Neural Network** architecture designed to enhance **deepfake audio detection** through quantum machine learning techniques. Key features include:

* **Quantum-to-classical parameter mapping** that enables up to **70% reduction in trainable parameters** without sacrificing detection accuracy.  
* A hybrid architecture combining **Quantum Neural Networks (QNNs)** with classical CNN layers for efficient and expressive model training.  
* Comprehensive **audio preprocessing pipeline**, including feature extraction, label encoding, and sequential dataset construction.

Experimental evaluations show that QT-CNN matches the accuracy of classical CNNs while offering improved computational efficiency, making it highly suitable for **resource-constrained environments** in **media forensics and audio security**.
