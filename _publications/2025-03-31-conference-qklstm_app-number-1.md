This paper presents an enhanced **QK-LSTM** (Quantum Kernel-Based Long Short-Term Memory) architecture for **climate time-series forecasting**, particularly focused on **Air Quality Index (AQI)** prediction. Key contributions include:

* Embedding inputs into **quantum feature spaces** to capture complex nonlinear and temporal patterns more efficiently.  
* Achieving **fewer trainable parameters** and faster convergence compared to classical and variational quantum circuit-based models.  
* Scalability for deployment on **NISQ-era hybrid systems**, addressing environmental monitoring challenges under computational constraints.

Empirical results confirm that QK-LSTM outperforms classical LSTM models in AQI prediction, offering a practical quantum-classical approach for large-scale, high-dimensional climate data modeling.
