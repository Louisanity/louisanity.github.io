This paper introduces a **Quantum-Enhanced Parameter-Efficient Learning** framework for **typhoon trajectory forecasting**, marking the first application of quantum machine learning (QML) in this domain. Key features include:

* Use of **Quantum Parameter Adaptation (QPA)** to train a hybrid **Attention-based Multi-ConvGRU** model with significantly **fewer trainable parameters**.  
* **Quantum-Train (QT)** methodology enables parameter generation during training using quantum neural networks, with no quantum hardware required at inference.  
* Demonstrated **accuracy and efficiency** on large-scale atmospheric datasets, with strong potential for scalable and **energy-efficient climate modeling**.

The framework showcases how QML can drive breakthroughs in **disaster forecasting** while improving accessibility and sustainability in high-performance computing.
