This paper introduces a **graph-based formulation** for generalised quantum circuit partitioning in the context of **Distributed Quantum Computing (DQC)**. The method addresses key limitations in current approaches by:

* **Jointly optimizing** both **gate and state teleportation** costs, rather than treating them separately.  
* Minimizing entanglement-based communication overhead to support scalable and efficient DQC architectures.  
* Using a **genetic algorithm** to explore optimal partitions, achieving lower **e-bit cost** and better **time performance** compared to state-of-the-art methods.

This work lays a foundation for more robust and cost-effective circuit execution across networked quantum processors, enabling practical horizontal scaling of quantum systems.
