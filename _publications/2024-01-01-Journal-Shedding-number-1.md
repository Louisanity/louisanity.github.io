At the dynamic intersection of artificial intelligence and quantum technology, quantum neural networks (QNNs) have emerged as a promising paradigm in quantum machine learning. This article provides a comprehensive review of QNN concepts and their physical realizations, focusing on implementations in quantum optics.

We examine how quantum principles can be integrated with classical neural network architectures to construct QNNs, reviewing models such as the quantum perceptron, quantum convolutional neural networks, and quantum Boltzmann machines. Particular attention is given to the feasibility of implementing these architectures using photonics-based techniques.

A major challenge in optical QNNs lies in achieving the necessary non-linear gates. We discuss emerging strategies, including measurement-induced nonlinearities, as promising routes to overcome this hurdle. Additionally, we highlight the role of non-Gaussian operations in unifying disparate QNN architectures, an insight that may guide the scalable design of more complex QNN systems.

Our analysis suggests that continued advancements in quantum optics and photonic control are key to realizing scalable QNN circuits capable of addressing high-dimensional quantum learning tasks.
