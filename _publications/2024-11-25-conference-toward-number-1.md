cuTN-QSVM harnesses NVIDIA’s **cuTensorNet** library (cuQuantum SDK) to accelerate Quantum Support Vector Machine simulations:

* **Scalability —** executes QSVM circuits with substantially more qubits than CPU-based simulators.  
* **Speed —** delivers major runtime reductions via high-performance GPU tensor-network contractions.  
* **Practical impact —** enables realistic benchmarking of quantum kernels, informing hardware–software co-design for next-generation quantum machine-learning applications.
