This paper presents a **resource-efficient compilation framework** for **distributed quantum circuits** aimed at solving large-scale **wireless sensor network (WSN) routing** problems. Core contributions include:

* Use of **spectral clustering** for network partitioning and **distributed QAOA** for subgraph optimization.  
* Formulation of the WSN routing task as a **Quadratic Unconstrained Binary Optimization (QUBO)** problem, enabling quantum-based solution strategies.  
* Demonstrated **energy savings and scalability** over classical algorithms, supporting efficient WSN operation in complex deployments.

This work showcases the **practical potential of quantum computing** in wireless communications, offering scalable, low-energy solutions for next-generation network optimization challenges.
