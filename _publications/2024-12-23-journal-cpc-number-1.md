This paper introduces **Active Pre-Cooling (APC)**, a novel method for reducing thermal photon occupation in **microwave and RF resonators** prior to measurement. Key aspects include:

* Coupling cavity modes to an **active cold load (ACL)**—specifically the input of a commercial **low-noise amplifier (LNA)**—to achieve substantial reductions in **noise temperature**.  
* Room-temperature demonstrations showing mode temperatures dropping to **123 K**, with a **5× improvement in signal-to-noise ratio** during time-resolved EPR experiments.  
* Feasibility modeling that supports extended thermal suppression using high-Q modes and cryogenic ACLs.

APC serves as a simple and powerful first-stage cooling method for improving sensitivity in **EPR spectroscopy**, **quantum sensing**, and **radiometric detection**, with direct applicability to both ambient and cryogenic regimes.
