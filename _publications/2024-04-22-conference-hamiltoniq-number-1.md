**HamilToniQ** introduces a comprehensive, open-source toolkit for benchmarking Quantum Processing Units (QPUs). Key features include:

* A staged workflow—**circuit compilation, error mitigation, and performance analysis**—tailored to diverse QPU types and topologies.  
* The **H-Score**, a unified metric that captures device fidelity and reliability to enable fair, transparent comparisons.  
* Validation across multiple IBM quantum devices, demonstrating robustness and practicality in real-world settings.  

By standardizing benchmarking practices and focusing on the Quantum Approximate Optimization Algorithm (QAOA), HamilToniQ advances the precision and clarity of QPU performance evaluation.
