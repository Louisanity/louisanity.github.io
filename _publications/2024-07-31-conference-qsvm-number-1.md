This paper presents a **Quantum-enhanced Support Vector Machine (QSVM)** tailored for complex stellar classification tasks using the Harvard system. Key features include:

* Superior performance compared to classical algorithms like **K-Nearest Neighbors** and **Logistic Regression** in both binary and multi-class classification.  
* **GPU-accelerated simulation** via NVIDIA’s cuQuantum SDK for scalable training on large astronomical datasets.  
* Significant gains in **accuracy and computational efficiency**, showcasing the strength of quantum machine learning in astrophysics.

The proposed QSVM model sets a new benchmark for stellar classification and demonstrates the growing role of quantum algorithms in scientific data analysis at scale.
