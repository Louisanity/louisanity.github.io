We present a novel strategy for optically pumping optically dense magnetic crystals using waveguide-assisted light injection. This technique addresses longstanding challenges in time-resolved electron paramagnetic resonance (TREPR), triplet-mediated dynamic nuclear polarisation (DNP), and cavity quantum electrodynamics (QED).

By embedding pentacene-doped p-terphenyl crystals onto custom-shaped optical waveguide ends, pump light is delivered deeply into the gain medium. Compared with conventional side-pumping approaches, this method reduces the masing threshold by a factor of 11 and enables 54 times greater pump energy absorption without damage, resulting in a record maser peak output of -5 dBm.

This invasive optical delivery mechanism opens new pathways for optically driven quantum technologies, particularly those exploiting strong light–matter interactions in solid-state systems at room temperature.
