This paper introduces the **Consensus-based Distributed Quantum Kernel Learning (CDQKL)** framework to advance **speech recognition** using quantum computing. Key contributions include:

* **Distributed learning** across quantum terminals connected via classical channels, ensuring **data privacy** by exchanging model parameters instead of raw data.  
* Improved **computational scalability** for quantum kernel methods applied to large-scale speech emotion recognition tasks.  
* Demonstrated **competitive performance** compared to centralized and local models, validating its potential in sectors requiring privacy-preserving ML such as **telecommunications, automotive, and finance**.

CDQKL represents a practical and secure approach to scaling quantum machine learning in distributed, privacy-sensitive environments.
