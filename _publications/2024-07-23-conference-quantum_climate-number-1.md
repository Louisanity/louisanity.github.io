This review outlines the transformative potential of **quantum computing (QC)** in addressing pressing global challenges in **climate resilience** and **sustainable development**. It focuses on:

* **Quantum machine learning** and **quantum optimization** for complex climate prediction and multi-infrastructure coordination.  
* Applications including **flood prevention**, **waste-to-energy conversion**, and **materials discovery** for carbon capture.  
* A comparative evaluation of current **quantum algorithms and hardware** in practical environmental use cases.

By leveraging QCâ€™s computational advantages, this work presents a pathway for advancing data-driven solutions to planetary-scale environmental and sustainability challenges.
