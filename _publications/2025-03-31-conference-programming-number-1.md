This paper presents **QT-QFWP**, a hybrid framework for programming **Variational Quantum Circuits (VQCs)** using **Quantum-Train-driven updates**. The model architecture features:

* A **quantum-controlled slow programmer** that manages classical parameters for a **fast-programmer VQC**, enabling dynamic and data-adaptive circuit configuration.  
* **Parameter compression of 70–90%** compared to QLSTM and traditional QFWP, significantly improving scalability.  
* Superior performance on **time-series forecasting tasks** like Damped SHM, NARMA5, and simulated gravitational waves.

QT-QFWP offers a viable solution for deploying VQCs on near-term quantum hardware, addressing limitations in qubit count and gate fidelity while maintaining prediction accuracy and runtime efficiency.
