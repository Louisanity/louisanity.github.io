## Teaching Overview

This course provides a comprehensive introduction to programming through the imperative core of the C++ language. It is designed specifically for postgraduate students in the Department of Medical Engineering at Taipei Medical University, many of whom come from non-computing backgrounds. The course content is adapted from an established version taught at Imperial College London, with an emphasis on practical problem-solving using ANSI/ISO standard C++ and the GNU g++ compiler.

Students engage in a structured sequence of lectures and lab-based exercises, using a UNIX-like development environment. By the end of the course, they gain hands-on experience in core programming constructs, procedural abstraction, debugging, and file I/O — essential skills for computational biomedical applications.

## Teaching Contributions

As a lecturer, I delivered the full series of lectures and supervised all associated practical lab sessions, covering the following modules:

- **Lecture 1: Introduction to Programming with C++**  
  History of C++, program structure, compilation, and first program walkthrough.

- **Lecture 2: Data Types and Variables**  
  Primitive data types, identifiers, constants, type casting, and enumeration types.

- **Lecture 3: Expressions and Input/Output**  
  Arithmetic expressions, shorthand operators, string manipulation, and standard I/O.

- **Lecture 4: Control Structures I – Branching**  
  Conditional logic, `if`, `else`, `switch` statements, and boolean expressions.

- **Lecture 5: Control Structures II – Looping**  
  Iterative constructs: `for`, `while`, `do-while`; loop nesting and scoping.

- **Lecture 6: Functions and Modular Design**  
  Function definitions, return types, parameters (by value and reference), and overloading.

- **Lecture 7: Arrays and Strings**  
  Single and multidimensional arrays, string handling, and array operations in functions.

- **Lecture 8: Pointers and Dynamic Memory**  
  Pointer syntax, memory allocation (`new`/`delete`), pointer arithmetic, and safety.

- **Lecture 9: File Handling and Streams**  
  File I/O, stream objects, error checking, input/output formatting, and `getline()`.

- **Lecture 10: Introduction to Object-Oriented Concepts**  
  Classes and objects, member functions, constructors, and encapsulation (brief overview).

- **Lecture 11: Recursion and Linked Structures**  
  Recursive functions, base cases, call stack mechanics, and simple linked list implementation.

- **Lecture 12: Debugging and Development Tools**  
  Using `g++`, Emacs, and GDB; debugging strategies, `assert`, stubs, and test harnesses.

## Learning Materials

- **Lecture Notes and Code Examples**  
  All example programs and exercises follow ANSI/ISO C++ standards and are tested using GNU g++.

- **Recommended Textbooks**  
  - *Walter Savitch*, *Problem Solving with C++* (10th Edition), Pearson, 2018.  
  - *Bjarne Stroustrup*, *Programming Principles and Practice Using C++* (3rd Edition), Pearson, 2024.

## Assessment Framework

- **60% Final Written Examination**  
  Assesses conceptual understanding, algorithmic reasoning, and ability to read and interpret C++ code.

- **40% Programming Project**  
  Individual programming assignment requiring design, implementation, documentation, and testing of a modular C++ application relevant to real-world biomedical or scientific computation.

This course equips students with robust programming fundamentals, preparing them for further study or application of software tools in medical engineering and health-related data analysis.
