## Teaching Overview
This course provides a comprehensive introduction to programming through the imperative core of the C++ language. It is designed specifically for postgraduate students in the Department of Medical Engineering at Taipei Medical University, many of whom come from non-computing backgrounds. The course content is adapted from a long-established version taught at Imperial College London, with a strong emphasis on practical problem-solving using ANSI/ISO standard C++ and the GNU g++ compiler.

Students engage in a structured sequence of lectures and lab-based exercises using a UNIX-like development environment. By the end of the course, they gain hands-on experience in core programming constructs, procedural abstraction, debugging, and file I/O — essential skills for computational biomedical applications.

## Teaching Contributions
As the lecturer, I delivered all lectures and supervised the associated practical sessions, covering the following topics:

- **Lecture 1: Introduction to Programming with C++**  
  History of C++, program structure, compilation, and first program walkthrough.

- **Lecture 2: Data Types and Variables**  
  Primitive types, identifiers, constants, type casting, and enumerations.

- **Lecture 3: Expressions and Input/Output**  
  Arithmetic expressions, shorthand operators, and standard I/O handling.

- **Lecture 4: Control Structures I – Branching**  
  Conditional logic using `if`, `else`, and `switch` statements.

- **Lecture 5: Control Structures II – Looping**  
  Iterative constructs: `for`, `while`, `do-while`, nested loops, and scope.

- **Lecture 6: Functions and Modular Design**  
  Function definitions, parameter passing (by value and reference), and overloading.

- **Lecture 7: Arrays and Strings**  
  One- and two-dimensional arrays, string handling, and manipulation.

- **Lecture 8: Pointers and Dynamic Memory**  
  Pointer syntax, dynamic memory management, and pointer arithmetic.

- **Lecture 9: File Handling and Streams**  
  File I/O using streams, input/output formatting, and error checking.

- **Lecture 10: Introduction to Object-Oriented Concepts**  
  Basic classes and objects, constructors, and encapsulation.

- **Lecture 11: Recursion and Linked Structures**  
  Recursive functions, the call stack, and linked list construction.

- **Lecture 12: Debugging and Development Tools**  
  Use of `g++`, Emacs, and GDB; debugging practices using `assert`, test stubs, and drivers.

## Learning Materials

- **Lecture Notes and Code Examples**  
  All exercises and examples are written in ANSI/ISO standard C++ and tested using the GNU g++ compiler.

- **Recommended Textbooks**  
  - *Walter Savitch*, *Problem Solving with C++* (10th Edition), Pearson, 2018.  
  - *Bjarne Stroustrup*, *Programming Principles and Practice Using C++* (3rd Edition), Pearson, 2024.

## Assessment Framework

- **60% Final Written Examination**  
  Tests theoretical understanding, code reasoning, and C++ syntax proficiency.

- **40% Programming Project**  
  A modular software project involving implementation, documentation, and evaluation of a C++ application relevant to biomedical or scientific computation.

This course equips students with foundational programming skills, enabling them to engage with computational methods and develop technical fluency for research or industry applications in medical engineering.
